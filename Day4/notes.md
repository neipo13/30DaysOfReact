In this we create some strangely broken down components. My expectation is that
we will break these down further in the future. I am however happy to not be writing hello world to the screen yet again.
* it is unclear if we are to be inlineing all the react components inside the single
script tag. There has been no mention of separation of files though so
* use className instead of class - class is already taken in JS (duh)
